title: Neuropsych Eval Complete!

Aaaand the neuropsychological evaluation is done! Everything passed with flying
colors. Dr. Drag interviewed my mom, my flight instructor, and my old choir
director in order to get a complete picture of me as a person. She also asked
for a copy of my most recent performance review from work. All in all, I think
this may be the last step (though I don't want to jinx it!)
