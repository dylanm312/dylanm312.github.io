# Found A Neurologist (finally!)

After many trials and tribulations, I was finally able to secure an appointment
with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. In hindsight, the many denials I received
while on the hunt for a neurologist actually proved to be a blessing in
disguise, since PAMF's rates are lower than almost all of the university
healthcare practices that I was reaching out to. So, at least that part of the
process is over. I have found a neurologist to do the rest of the work the FAA
needs.

# Neuro Eval Went Swimmingly

Last Thursday, I did my neuro evaluation, and passed with flying colors. I got a
perfect score on the dementia test (MoCA, the same one as our former president
famously screwed up, a la "Person, Man, Woman, Camera, TV") and my reflexes and
other nervous system tests were perfect. Everything was looking great...

# EEG...Not So Much

...until the EEG. I was supposed to be sleep-deprived, but slept through my
alarm and so I got a full 6 hours of sleep instead of 3 (oops!). Because of
this, I wasn't able to fall asleep during the test like they wanted me too (oops
again). The icing on the cake was that they actually found an abnormality during
the test, most likely unrelated to epilepsy, but who knows? I have an MRI
scheduled on 5/20 to dig deeper into this. We'll see what we find.
