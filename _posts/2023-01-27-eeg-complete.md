title: EEG Complete! But...
categories: flying medical

The EEG is done! It came back normal. One more thing off the list.

1. ~~A 24-hr EEG ($865)~~
2. A neuropsychological evaluation ($3500)

The unfortunate news is that I was misquoted by the billing department. They
told me the procedure would cost $865, but then sent me a bill for $7920. I of
course plan to fight this bill since I have written email communication of them
quoting me a different price. The battle continues.
