After a grueling 6 months of waiting, tracking down a neurologist, shelling out
for a neuro eval, EEG, and MRI, and waiting for the results to be finalized, the
day finally came. I assembled all my documentation, including my cover letter,
medical record, current testing information, and more, and I sent it off to the
FAA. Now comes the hardest part - waiting. I expect it will take about 4-5
months to hear back from the FAA. They may want a CogScreen, or they may not. We
will find out soon...
