title: Welcome to my blog!
---

I started this blog mostly to learn about Jekyll, Ruby, and GitHub Pages. But I think it
also serves a good secondary purpose for me to write about my experiences as I teach
myself different languages and set myself up for a career change into software. Having
worked almost exclusively with high-level languages like Python, JavaScript, and the
web dev languages, I expect that learning the low-level stuff like C will prove quite 
challenging. I hope that you'll follow me along as I expand my horizons and keep finding
new applications for the tools in my tool belt.
