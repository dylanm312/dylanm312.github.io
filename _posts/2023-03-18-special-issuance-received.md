After a grueling 15-month battle, my Special Issuance authorization and
3rd-class medical certificate arrived in the mail on Wednesday, March 15th. It's
finally done! Now I can transition to BasicMed and never have to deal with this
ever again (although, to be fair, the only thing they are asking me for in order
to renew the medical if I wanted to do so is just a clinical progress note - not too hard!).

The table below represents my total expenses to receive the special issuance,
pending the bill for the 24hr EEG. I've engaged the federal PPDR process and an
internal review with Sutter Health, but haven't heard a peep from either of
them. Perhaps it's better to let a sleeping dog lie.

In any case, this is cause for celebration! I am considering moving back down
to San Luis Obispo temporarily to pick up my flight training with my previous
instructor and knock out my certificate!
