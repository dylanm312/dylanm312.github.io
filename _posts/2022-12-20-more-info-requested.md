On November 3rd, I received a reply from the FAA. They want yet another round of
testing. However, based on conversations with the FAA regional office, I'm
hopeful that this will be the last round.

This time, they're asking for:

1. A 24-hr EEG ($865)
2. A neuropsychological evaluation ($3500)

The good news is that this time around, I already have a neurologist (at PAMF)
and an neuropsychologist (Dr. Drag in Los Gatos) ready and willing to get me the
testing the FAA needs. So I can skip the month-long search for a provider that I
had to do the first time. I don't want to get my hopes up, but it looks like
my medical is within reach! (to the tune of several months and another $4500, of
course. Can we expect anything less from the FAA?)
