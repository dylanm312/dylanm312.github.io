# No One Wants My Money :(

It turns out - shockingly - that doctors are not very eager to see you if
there's nothing wrong with you. However, I didn't think they would actually turn
me away. Here I am, ready to give up thousands of my hard-earned Benjamins, and
every neurologist so far has turned me away. They say their case load is full,
or they don't have the equipment for an MRI, or they feel like they're "not
quite right for the job", whatever that means. I can't think of any other time
in my life where I've offered to pay someone literal thousands of dollars and
been turned away.

# Except for one (maybe)

There is a university up in the Bay Area that may be willing to see me. It will
cost a pretty penny, because it's the Bay, but at least there might be a path
forward for me. It's incredible how hard I've had to fight just to get so much
as a consult.

In any case, hopefully I'll get a neuro appointment scheduled in the near
future. Fingers crossed!
