Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. I created this site primarily in order to teach myself how to use Jekyll, Ruby,
and GitHub Pages together. Additionally, I hope that you might enjoy reading about my passion projects and other
various life happenings that I may write about from time to time.

# Academic

I received a B.S. in Industrial Engineering concurrently with an M.S. in
Engineering Management from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Though my formal
education is in industrial/quality engineering, my true passion is programming. I'm a self-taught
developer with most of my experience in web development (case in point: this blog) and Python.
I'm also currently teaching myself C so I can start to work on some lower-level code as well.

# Personal

When I'm not analyzing time studies or writing code, my main passion is music. I've been involved in choir
through my old high school and through Cal Poly for 8 continuous years. I also play a bit of ukulele and piano here and there.
Additionally, I have a passion for aviation and am currently working towards my Private Pilot certificate.
